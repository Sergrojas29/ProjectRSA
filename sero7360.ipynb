Using the properties of large prime numbers to create a unique pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. This method is highly secure while being simple in its concept, and while easy to create by factorizing the large primary number is it proves more difficult to break with larger and larger prime numbers.  \n",

RSA relies on several number theories that have been studied for centuries, From early mathematician interest in the unique properties of prime numbers.   For example, the Euclidean algorithm and the Extended Euclidean algorithm are huge part in our creation of, and determining the correct public and private key to make our encryption. Along with fast modular exponentiation simplifies the key creation process, ensuring that decryption without the private key becomes practically impossible as prime numbers increase in size. This security remains effective with modern computer systems.  \n",

    "My process was to understand each step of the code. Sometimes it took some time, but it helped with debugging. Using the website book from Intro to Comp 1300 to see each step helped a lot, especially with the extended Euclidean Algorithm. The website creates a table of value to be visible at each step. The lecture felt a bit confusing then when I was doing it by hand, but the code seemed so simple that it didn’t seem correct. Printing at almost every step while writing code is very important. One huge mistake that took me hours to fix was a simple error with fast modular exponentiation. While writing, I never took the time to ensure the small details were correct. It took me hours to realize that the issue I was having with the equation was due to using the wrong exponent that should be squared. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another great help was the video posted by one of our classmates on Piazza. The video did a great job explaining why fast modular exponentiation worked with converting numbers to bits. In the video she went step by step that the video just wrote a pseudocode and kind of skipped until the answer. Without that I don’t think I would have written the right code. Include being able to test and debug.  \n",
    "\n",
    "During the process, I also created another file to test and rewrite the code at multiple steps. I tried to create lots of notes that I had to remove so not to confuse my actual code in the brainstorming. I used VS Code as a coding environment, which significantly reduced most syntax errors that are hard to catch in JupyterLab. To use IntelliSense in VS Code, I had to write the Python code in a .py file instead of a Jupyter notebook. Another helpful element learn during the project was the ASSERT statement in Python. It was a major help to test that the code passes while aiding in debugging. Assert was such a great way to write using test-oriented design that’s baked right into the vanilla python.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Most helpful were Google, Stack Overflow, and, when things got too complicated, ChatGPT. Although I found an error using chatGPT with large prime numbers and their modularization. For example, during some testing of a very large prime number, I initially got a wrong number. When checking by hand, I got the correct answer (though I didn’t know it at the time). Using a regular mod calculator online it gave me the same error, and finally, using a fast modular calculator gave the same (correct) answer I got by hand. That also caused me to lose a lot of time due to some small issues. But since I was testing the code and the checks weren’t working, I had to understand why it didn’t work. \n",
    "\n",
    "I think the most rewarding part of the project was the code exchange. It was interesting to see that most people were also getting low numbers for public key e. I think it must have to do with how we find the number that will be relatively prime to the others we chose. When we look for the number, we have a range from 2 through the product of (p-1)*(q-1). So, it usually picks the first number that fits the equation. Also, understanding why having a main function will create an easier and much faster way to both encrypt and decrypt.\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest challenge of this project was testing and understanding it. Using a cooking metaphor, it was like making a Thanksgiving turkey. The longest time was spent creating and understanding why each measuring bowl needed to be the correct size. The steps were clear, and after making sure the measuring tools were correct, the steps were as easy as putting a meal in the microwave. The presentation of the turkey was like the code exchange, and being able to decode the message was like seeing everyone’s face as they tasted the turkey. Watching their faces smile with delight was like successfully decrypting the message. Even though it felt like once we checked and understood the measurement tools, you just throw the turkey into the microwave, yet it was cooked perfectly. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So I'm guessing the add the word fortitude was to catch ai prompts but incase it was a check to see if we read the instruction, fortituted!"
