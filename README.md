## 1. Introduction to your RSA Project (5 points) 
<p> RSA encryption in one of the oldest and widely used methods for the transmission of secure data. Using the properties of large prime numbers to create a unique pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. This method is highly secure while being simple in its concept, and while easy to create by factorizing the large primary number is it proves more difficult to break with larger and larger prime numbers.  

The acronym RSA stands for Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman, who developed the algorithm in 1977. RSA relies on several number theories that have been studied for centuries, From early mathematician interest in the unique properties of prime numbers.   For example, the Euclidean algorithm and the Extended Euclidean algorithm are huge part in our creation of, and determining the correct public and private key to make our encryption. Along with fast modular exponentiation simplifies the key creation process, ensuring that decryption without the private key becomes practically impossible as prime numbers increase in size. This security remains effective with modern computer systems.  

This project will begin with simple functions derived from number theories, progressing step-by-step to generate public and private keys. It will then cover the processes of creating, sending, and decrypting encrypted messages. Through this comprehensive approach, we will explore the mathematical foundations and practical applications of RSA encryption.</p>
